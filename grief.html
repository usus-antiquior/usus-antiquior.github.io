<p>The 5 Stages of Grief</p>
<ol>
<li>Denial</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Bargaining</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Acceptance</li>
</ol>
<p>The 5 Stages of Grief are not intended to be worked through and &ldquo;checked off,&rdquo; like a list. Rather, they are guideposts, helping us identify and understand what we may be feeling. Not everyone will experience every stage, and many people will go through the stages in a different order. In general, however, grief will include the following 5 phases.</p>
<p>Denial:</p>
<p>This stage includes feelings of shock, numbness, and disbelief. When loss first comes, most of us have a hard time believing &ldquo;this is really happening.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not that we&lsquo;re denying that the death or loss has actually occurred, but rather, it&rsquo;s a sense of, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe this person I love isn&rsquo;t going to walk through that door anymore.&rdquo; Yet, the feelings of this stage also protect us. If we were to take in all the emotion related to the loss right away, it would be too overwhelming. Instead, our body and mind have a little time to adjust to the way things are now without the deceased. Part of the &ldquo;denial&rdquo; stage is also to tell our story over and over&mdash;one of the best ways to deal with trauma, and also a way for us to make it real. Eventually, we may begin asking questions such as, &ldquo;How did this happen,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; This is a sign that we are moving out of the denial phase and into the feeling and healing process.</p>
<p>Anger:</p>
<p>Anger can present itself in a variety of ways&mdash;anger at your loved one, at others, at God, at the world, at yourself. And anger can be a difficult emotion to cope with. Some will express anger easily and toward anyone or anything, but many of us will suppress the anger instead, keeping it bottled up or even turning it inward, toward ourselves. Anger turned inward is guilt&mdash;guilt that we &ldquo;should have done something,&rdquo; or even guilt that we feel angry toward the deceased. But anger is a natural response to loss. And if we&rsquo;re able to identify and label our anger, it can help us express it in healthier ways that don&rsquo;t hurt others or ourselves. Saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry,&rdquo; and letting yourself feel that anger is part of the healing process.</p>
<p>Bargaining</p>
<p>With bargaining, there&rsquo;s a sense that we just want life back to the way it used to be. We wish we could go back in time, catch the illness sooner, see something we didn&rsquo;t see. We may also feel guilty, focusing on &ldquo;If only&hellip;&rdquo;. Bargaining can begin before the loss occurs or after. If the death or loss was anticipated, such as in the case of illness, bargaining may have been going on for a while&mdash;we bargain with God to please &ldquo;spare&rdquo; our loved one; we say we&rsquo;ll &ldquo;do anything&rdquo; to keep them here. If the death or loss was sudden, we may wish we could bring them back or go back in time and change things. Bargaining keeps us focused on the past so we don&rsquo;t have to feel the emotions of the present. But bargaining can be helpful too. Once we accept that our loved one is dying, we can use bargaining to ease our minds and theirs, praying for a &ldquo;peaceful passing.&rdquo; Or once they have passed, bargaining can help us focus on the future as we pray to &ldquo;be reunited with them someday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Depression</p>
<p>Eventually grief will enter on a deeper level, bringing with it intense feelings of emptiness and sadness. We feel like we don&rsquo;t care about much of anything and wish life would just hurry up and pass on by. Getting out of bed can be a huge burden, exhaustion and apathy can set in, and we may begin to wonder, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; for pretty much everything. Others around us may try to help get us &ldquo;out&rdquo; of this &ldquo;depression,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s important to know that this isn&rsquo;t a mental illness&mdash;it&rsquo;s a natural response to loss. It&rsquo;s not a clinical depression we&rsquo;re experiencing, but rather bereavement and mourning, and the emotions of depression must be experienced in order to heal. We have to let ourselves feel the pain, loss, grief, and sadness, hard as it may seem. As Kubler-Ross encourages, &ldquo;Make a place for your guest. Invite your depression to pull up a chair with you in front of the fire, and sit with it, without looking for a way to escape. Allow the sadness and emptiness to cleanse you and help you explore your loss in its entirety.&rdquo; This part of the grief process can last for some time&mdash;there&rsquo;s no set &ldquo;time limit&rdquo; for the emotions of grief. So be patient with yourself, and remember that feeling the &ldquo;depression&rdquo; is the way out of it.</p>
<p>Acceptance</p>
<p>The experience of &ldquo;depression&rdquo; is what leads to &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo;. Many people mistakenly believe that &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; means we are &ldquo;cured&rdquo; or &ldquo;all right&rdquo; with the loss. But this isn&rsquo;t the case at all. The loss will forever be a part of us, though we will feel it more some times than others. Acceptance simply means we are ready to try and move on&mdash;to accommodate ourselves to this world without our loved one. This process can actually bring us closer to the one we loved as we make sense of how life was and process how we want life now to be.</p>
<p>Understanding the 5 Stages of Grief can help us realize our grief is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and help us navigate the varying symptoms we each experience. Mostly, however, understanding the 5 Stages of Grief can reassure us that we are not alone in our grief&mdash;that grief is one experience we will all have (or will have) in common. And that means, if we choose to, we have plenty of experienced souls to whom we can turn for support and guidance through our times of grief.</p>
        <hr class="solid">
<p>The stages have evolved since their introduction and they have been very misunderstood over the past three decades. They were never meant to help tuck messy emotions into neat packages. They are responses to loss that many people have, but there is not a typical response to loss as there is no typical loss. Our grief is as individual as our lives.</p>
<p>The five stages, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of them or in a prescribed order. Our hope is that with these stages comes the knowledge of grief &lsquo;s terrain, making us better equipped to cope with life and loss. At times, people in grief will often report more stages. Just remember your grief is an unique as you are.</p>
<p>DENIAL - This first stage of grieving helps us to survive the loss. In this stage, the world becomes meaningless and overwhelming. Life makes no sense. We are in a state of shock and denial. We go numb. We wonder how we can go on, if we can go on, why we should go on. We try to find a way to simply get through each day. Denial and shock help us to cope and make survival possible. Denial helps us to pace our feelings of grief. There is a grace in denial. It is nature&rsquo;s way of letting in only as much as we can handle. As you accept the reality of the loss and start to ask yourself questions, you are unknowingly beginning the healing process. You are becoming stronger, and the denial is beginning to fade. But as you proceed, all the feelings you were denying begin to surface.</p>
<p>ANGER - Anger is a necessary stage of the healing process. Be willing to feel your anger, even though it may seem endless. The more you truly feel it, the more it will begin to dissipate and the more you will heal. There are many other emotions under the anger and you will get to them in time, but anger is the emotion we are most used to managing. The truth is that anger has no limits. It can extend not only to your friends, the doctors, your family, yourself and your loved one who died, but also to God. You may ask, &ldquo;Where is God in this? Underneath anger is pain, your pain. It is natural to feel deserted and abandoned, but we live in a society that fears anger. Anger is strength and it can be an anchor, giving temporary structure to the nothingness of loss. At first grief feels like being lost at sea: no connection to anything. Then you get angry at someone, maybe a person who didn&rsquo;t attend the funeral, maybe a person who isn&rsquo;t around, maybe a person who is different now that your loved one has died. Suddenly you have a structure &ndash; &ndash; your anger toward them. The anger becomes a bridge over the open sea, a connection from you to them. It is something to hold onto; and a connection made from the strength of anger feels better than nothing.We usually know more about suppressing anger than feeling it. The anger is just another indication of the intensity of your love.</p>
<p>BARGAINING - Before a loss, it seems like you will do anything if only your loved one would be spared. &ldquo;Please God, &rdquo; you bargain, &ldquo;I will never be angry at my wife again if you&rsquo;ll just let her live.&rdquo; After a loss, bargaining may take the form of a temporary truce. &ldquo;What if I devote the rest of my life to helping others. Then can I wake up and realize this has all been a bad dream?&rdquo; We become lost in a maze of &ldquo;If only&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if&hellip;&rdquo; statements. We want life returned to what is was; we want our loved one restored. We want to go back in time: find the tumor sooner, recognize the illness more quickly, stop the accident from happening&hellip;if only, if only, if only. Guilt is often bargaining&rsquo;s companion. The &ldquo;if onlys&rdquo; cause us to find fault in ourselves and what we &ldquo;think&rdquo; we could have done differently. We may even bargain with the pain. We will do anything not to feel the pain of this loss. We remain in the past, trying to negotiate our way out of the hurt. People often think of the stages as lasting weeks or months. They forget that the stages are responses to feelings that can last for minutes or hours as we flip in and out of one and then another. We do not enter and leave each individual stage in a linear fashion. We may feel one, then another and back again to the first one.</p>
<p>DEPRESSION - After bargaining, our attention moves squarely into the present. Empty feelings present themselves, and grief enters our lives on a deeper level, deeper than we ever imagined. This depressive stage feels as though it will last forever. It&rsquo;s important to understand that this depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great loss. We withdraw from life, left in a fog of intense sadness, wondering, perhaps, if there is any point in going on alone? Why go on at all? Depression after a loss is too often seen as unnatural: a state to be fixed, something to snap out of. The first question to ask yourself is whether or not the situation you&rsquo;re in is actually depressing. The loss of a loved one is a very depressing situation, and depression is a normal and appropriate response. To not experience depression after a loved one dies would be unusual. When a loss fully settles in your soul, the realization that your loved one didn&rsquo;t get better this time and is not coming back is understandably depressing. If grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way.</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE - Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being &ldquo;all right&rdquo; or &ldquo;OK&rdquo; with what has happened. This is not the case. Most people don&rsquo;t ever feel OK or all right about the loss of a loved one. This stage is about accepting the reality that our loved one is physically gone and recognizing that this new reality is the permanent reality. We will never like this reality or make it OK, but eventually we accept it. We learn to live with it. It is the new norm with which we must learn to live. We must try to live now in a world where our loved one is missing. In resisting this new norm, at first many people want to maintain life as it was before a loved one died. In time, through bits and pieces of acceptance, however, we see that we cannot maintain the past intact. It has been forever changed and we must readjust. We must learn to reorganize roles, re-assign them to others or take them on ourselves. Finding acceptance may be just having more good days than bad ones. As we begin to live again and enjoy our life, we often feel that in doing so, we are betraying our loved one. We can never replace what has been lost, but we can make new connections, new meaningful relationships, new inter-dependencies. Instead of denying our feelings, we listen to our needs; we move, we change, we grow, we evolve. We may start to reach out to others and become involved in their lives. We invest in our friendships and in our relationship with ourselves. We begin to live again, but we cannot do so until we have given grief its time.</p>
